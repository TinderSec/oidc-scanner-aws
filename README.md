# GHA OIDC SCANNER - AWS by Tinder Security Labs

## ABOUT

This is a GitHub Action built by Tinder Security Labs as part of public release of research done on configurations for AWS and GHA OIDC setups. This workflow allows organizations to monitor and identify vulnerabilities in their IAM roles through a black-box security approach. 

## Usage
Use the following sample workflow and setup guidellines to setup and run this GHA in your organization. We recommend using this action in a **private** repository. 

### Scanning private repositories
Replace the `${{ github.token }}` with a private PAT if you want to scan private/internal repositories. In order to securely store and use the API key, create a secret and replace `${{ github.token }}` with `${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_VAR }}`


### Sample Workflow

```
name: GHA Scanner Action - OIDC
on:
 workflow_dispatch: 

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  ScanVulns:
    env:
      AWS_REGION: us-east-1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Git clone the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Action IP
        run: curl https://ifconfig.me
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install @actions/core@1.6.0-beta.0 
      - run: pip install boto3
      - uses: TinderSec/oidc-scanner-aws@main
        env:
          PAT: ${{ github.token }}
```

## Output

If role(s) are found vulnerable, an artifact will be created in the ran job with `vulnerable-arns.json.zip` file. This zip will include a single JSON file that contains the role name and the associated repository/workflow location. Example JSON file: 

```
[
    {
        "ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME/sample_workflow.yaml": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
    }
]
```
